# Rustynet

An opensource echonet-lite to MQTT bridge built in rust powered by echonet-lite-rs.


## About

This is my 2nd try at implementing something like it. The first one is already
running in my home network but has very bad design, some weird bugs and I am
def not proud of it so I am starting from scratch, this time forcing me to write
cleaner code from the get go as making it open from day 1.

I do this on my own personal time focusing on the devices I have access to.
However I do welcome contributions.

## Copying

The same as the upstream echonet-lite-rs code, this code is dual licensed:

- MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is to make it easier to use and contribute to both.
